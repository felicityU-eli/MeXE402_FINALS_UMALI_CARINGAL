# MeXE402 - Mechatronics Engineering Elective 2: Data Science and Machine Learning
## Pair-Based Final Project - OpenCV Basics
## Introduction
Detecting faces in group photos is a vital challenge in computer vision. Unlike single-face detection, it involves handling variations in size, pose, lighting, and occlusion. These complexities arise from diverse expressions, crowded backgrounds, and overlapping faces. Accurate detection is essential for applications like photo tagging, social media analysis, and security surveillance. Advancing this task enhances the effectiveness and versatility of facial recognition systems.

### Dataset Description
## Abstract
The objective of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting faces in a group photo. Leveraging insights and techniques from a face detection tutorial, we aim to apply these learnings to a chosen image featuring the members of the K-pop group TWICE. The approach involves utilizing advanced computer vision methods to identify and highlight individual faces within the photo. The expected outcome is a processed image where each member of TWICE has their face outlined with a rectangular highlight, demonstrating precise and effective face detection. This project underscores the application of computer vision techniques in real-world scenarios.

## Project Methods
Files:
- Import the face cascade classifier file provided in the tutorial video.
- Import the group photo of TWICE members.

Coding:
- Import necessary libraries and functions for face detection.
- Convert the image to grayscale to meet the requirements of the face detection code.
- Apply the face detection algorithm to identify faces in the image.
- Overlay rectangular highlights on the detected faces.
- Display the final output image with highlighted faces.
